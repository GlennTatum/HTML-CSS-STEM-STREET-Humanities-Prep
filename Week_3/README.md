# Class Overview 3-3-23

Today in class we started writing out a basic outline for our Resume with HTML and CSS using the online integrated development environment Replit. We went over how to use the `style.css` file in combination with our `index.html` file to style HTML tags such as the `<header>`.

### Class Objectives and Tasks

- Center text within our `<header>` element with `text-align: center;`
    - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align)
- Change the background color element of our `<header>` with `background-color: blue;`
    - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color)
- Change the font of an element with `font-family: monospace;`
    - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)
- Add a border to an element with `border: solid black 5px;`

### CSS Notes

When writing a CSS style in `style.css` follow this format.

Once an element is assigned styles to write the following styles in this format

`style: attribute;`

```css
header {
	color: grey;
}
```

### HTML Notes

Elements are designed to be opened `<element>` and closed by pre-appending a `/` to the elements name `</element>`. Make sure to close your tag after creating a new element!

```html
<header>
	<p>My Header</p>
</header>
```
